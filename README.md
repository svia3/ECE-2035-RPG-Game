# ECE2035 - MIPS Pipeline 
This is a project that I created during my Fall 2018 semester at the Georgia Institute of Technology for a class that I am currently an undergraduate teaching assistant for, entitled
Programming for Software and Hardware Systems. This project utilizes a hash table backing strucutre in C++ to store game items
such as character sprites and items on the mBed platform.
